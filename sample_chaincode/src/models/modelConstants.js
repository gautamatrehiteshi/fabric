/**
 * Constants specific to the chaincode model
 *
 * Whenever possible, you should use constants instead of plain string.
 * By centralising all your constants, you can quickly spot overlapping references/constants
 * and updating existing constants values will not break any code.
 *
 * Add your own constants to this file and be sure to use them whenever possible.
